        "question": "What if 'Mean Girls' had foregone its lighthearted, 'easy satire' and 'extremely dumb' comedic moments for a 'genuinely unnerving' and 'tricky and satisfying' psychological examination of high school social warfare, sacrificing mainstream appeal for profound critical impact?",
        "context": "Some critics found the film's 'satire too easy to be genuinely satisfying' [3] and its overall execution 'extremely dumb,' 'confusing,' and 'boring' [1]. A shift to a more 'genuinely unnerving' [2] and 'tricky and satisfying' [8] narrative could have offered a deeper, albeit less broadly appealing, commentary on the social hierarchy, moving beyond a 'dreary indulgence' [4] towards a more complex critical reception."

        "question": "What if Cady Heron's character arc had culminated in her permanently embodying the 'Plastic' mentality, making her subsequent choices 'harder and harder to understand' and leaving viewers with a 'genuinely unnerving' and unresolved commentary on power, rather than a neatly 'satisfying niblet' of redemption?",
        "context": "The idea of a character making 'harder and harder to understand her choices' [7] could have been applied to Cady. If she had remained a 'Plastic,' the film could have explored a 'genuinely unnerving' [2] outcome, contrasting with the 'too easy to be genuinely satisfying' [3] resolution and instead offering a darker, more complex narrative than a simple 'satisfying niblet' [6] of a happy ending. This would challenge the 'extremely confusing' [1] feeling of a character arc that conveniently resolves."
